<h1>How do top students study?</h1>
<p>
If you attended or are going to a top school like MIT, Harvard, Columbia, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Cornell, Caltech, Princeton, Yale, Brown, UPenn, what is your studying method?

Could you please give advice on how to study the best possible way (especially for math classes)? How do you get good grades at the top universities? Please give me directions, like what you do before a lecture, after, during weekends, how you study the book, how many books you read, how you take the tests, how much do you study, etc.

I am a computer science major.</p>

<h1>Answer : I was a decent student...</h1>
<p>I was a decent student back when I was an MIT undergrad and now that I'm a prof, and I really want my students to do well. Every semester, I email them a link to the following article by Cal Newport: http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/..., which pretty much summarizes everything in about a thousand words.

If you don't have time to read the article, the hypothesis is that your brain absorbs information best in small chunks, so the key simply is CONSISTENCY.

Learn topics that you are taught as soon as they are introduced in class and learn them well in small chunks. Do your problem sets diligently and put effort into understanding the material. Math requires practice if you want to solve questions consistently under exam conditions. How much practice you need will depend on your level of maturity (in Math).

Do not count on last minute cramming right before exams to do well. Cramming might work (i.e. get you decent grades in the exams) during the first two years when the material is relatively simple, but if you don't learn the basics well, you might end up having trouble with the more advanced material that will build on the basics. It might be hard to catch up once you have a gap in your understanding in the early years.</p>
